# Group-666 - Project 1 "Beer Me"
Project 1 : Matt, John, Kellen, Andrew

## USERSTORY:
AS A beer connoisseur, I WANT a list of close breweries, SO THAT I can chose which one I'm most interested in from a list of options

## Beer Me
Beer Me is an app designed to help those thirsty beer connoisseurs locate a local beer establishment.  This app searches for local breweries and brewpubs, shows their location on a map, and allows the user to click on a desired brewery/brewpub for more details.

## Motivation
At Beer Me, we wanted to build out a beer-specific app to cut through the noise and get to the heart of delicious beers available within a close proximity.

## Features
Beer Me simplifies users search for local breweries.

## Code Example

## How to use?
Enter desired city name.  A map will populate close breweries where you will be able to select a brewery and view it's details (address, style, phone number, hours, etc)
